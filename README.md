Project based on Farmar, equipment and traders. Farmar order one or many iems for farming products and trader see and trading

## Project Overview

**Farm to Market** is an innovative web application developed to bridge the gap between farmers and traders in the agricultural industry. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as **Spring Boot**, **JPA (Java Persistence API)**, and **Hibernate**, this project aims to create a seamless online marketplace for buying and selling agricultural products and equipment. In this document, we will delve into the key components, features, and technical aspects of the Farm to Market project.

## Key Components

### User Management

Farm to Market features a robust user management system that plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security and accountability of the platform. Users are divided into two distinct categories: **Farmers** and **Traders**.

#### Farmers

Farmers, as the primary sellers on the platform, have the ability to list their agricultural products and equipment for sale. They are required to provide comprehensive details, including:

- **Mobile Number**: A unique identifier for each user.
- **State**: The geographical state or region where the farmer is located.
- **City**: The farmer's city of residence.
- **Pin Code**: The postal code of the user's area.
- **Role**: Farmers are assigned the "farmer" role for identification.
- **Username**: A chosen username for logging in.
- **Password**: A secure password for account protection.

#### Traders

Traders, on the other hand, can browse the listings and place orders for products and equipment. They share similar user details with farmers, differing only in their assigned "trader" role.

### Item Management

Farmers are empowered to manage their agricultural items efficiently through the platform. They can create listings for products they wish to sell, offering comprehensive information such as:

- **Item Name**: A clear and descriptive name for the product.
- **Item Description**: Detailed information about the product, its type, and quality.
- **Item Quantity**: The quantity available for sale.
- **User**: The user who listed the item (the farmer).

Traders, while exploring the platform, can view these listings and initiate orders for the desired items. Upon placing an order, the platform updates the item's available quantity, ensuring real-time inventory management.

### Equipment Management

In addition to agricultural products, Farm to Market offers support for the rental and sale of agricultural equipment. Farmers can list their equipment, specifying crucial details, including:

- **Name**: The name or type of equipment.
- **Count**: The number of units available.
- **Rent Per Day**: The daily rental rate for the equipment.
- **State**: The state where the equipment is located.
- **City**: The city in which the equipment is available.
- **Village**: The specific village or area.
- **Pin Code**: The equipment's postal code.
- **Contact Person**: The person responsible for managing the equipment.
- **Mobile Number**: The contact number for inquiries.
- **Status**: The availability status of the equipment (e.g., "Available" or "Booked").
- **User**: The user who listed the equipment (the farmer).

This detailed equipment information ensures traders can make informed decisions when renting or purchasing equipment. Additionally, the status information allows them to check equipment availability in real time.

### Order Processing

Farm to Market has a sophisticated order processing system that enables traders to place orders for items and equipment. This process is designed to be secure, and only authorized users can place orders. When an order is successfully placed, the platform automatically updates the available quantity of the ordered item or equipment.

## Database Integration

Data storage and retrieval are managed seamlessly using JPA and Hibernate, allowing for efficient and organized data management. JPA is a Java-based specification for managing data in relational databases, while Hibernate is a powerful and flexible ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and databases.

## Repository and Query Customization

### Equipment Repository

The Equipment Repository is equipped with custom queries that enhance the search capabilities of the application. These queries enable users to find equipment based on specific criteria:

#### Query 1: Find Equipment by City

This query allows users to search for equipment based on the city. Users can input the desired city code to retrieve relevant equipment listings.

```java
List<Equipment> findByCity(@Param("city") String code);
```

The `@Param` annotation in this context specifies a named parameter that users can use to filter equipment listings by city.

#### Query 2: Find Equipment by User ID

Users can find all equipment listings associated with a particular user by providing the user's ID.

```java
List<Equipment> findAllEquipment(Integer id);
```

#### Query 3: Find Equipment by Count

This query retrieves all equipment listings with a count greater than zero.

```java
List<Equipment> findEquipmentByCount();
```

### Item Repository

The Item Repository features a query to retrieve item details by their unique ID.

#### Query 1: Find Item by ID

Users can fetch item details by providing the item's ID.

```java
Item findById(Integer itemId);
```

This query ensures that users can access comprehensive information about a specific item.


Authentication and Authorization
Farm to Market's REST API incorporates robust authentication and authorization procedures to ensure that only authenticated users with the appropriate permissions can access their accounts and perform authorized actions. In our API, we utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
A JWT is a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. In Farm to Market, JWTs play a crucial role in user authentication. Here's an overview of how they work:

User Login: When a user logs in, our system generates a JWT containing user-specific information and a unique identifier. The token is signed with a secret key that only the server knows.

Token Issuance: The server sends this token back to the client.

Subsequent Requests: For every request made by the user to our API, the JWT is included in the request's header.

Token Verification: The server verifies the token's signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

Authorization: If the token is valid and the user has the required permissions, the request is processed. Otherwise, the server returns an error.

Code Example: Token Generation
Here's a simplified code snippet for generating a JWT upon user login:

java
Copy code
import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
import io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureAlgorithm;

// Generate a JWT token
public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
    long expiration = /* Set the token expiration time */;
    String secret = /* Your secret key */;
    
    return Jwts.builder()
            .setSubject(userDetails.getUsername())
            .setIssuedAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()))
            .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + expiration))
            .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, secret)
            .compact();
}
Code Example: Token Verification
This code demonstrates how to verify and extract user information from a received JWT:

java
Copy code
import io.jsonwebtoken.Claims;
import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
import io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureException;

// Verify and extract information from a JWT token
public Claims verifyToken(String token) {
    String secret = /* Your secret key */;
    
    try {
        return Jwts.parser()
                .setSigningKey(secret)
                .parseClaimsJws(token)
                .getBody();
    } catch (SignatureException e) {
        // Handle invalid tokens
        return null;
    }
}
These code examples illustrate a simplified JWT-based authentication and authorization system within our REST API. In a real-world application, you would integrate these components into your user management and request processing mechanisms, including the assignment of roles and permissions.


## Professional Terminology

Farm to Market utilizes the Spring Boot framework for rapid application development. Spring Boot simplifies the development process by offering pre-built configurations and tools, allowing developers to focus on writing application code rather than setting up infrastructure.

In terms of architecture, Farm to Market adheres to RESTful principles. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It promotes scalability, simplicity, and the use of standard HTTP methods for communication.

The application incorporates user roles and permissions, a fundamental aspect of access control. User roles determine the actions and features that users can access. For example, farmers and traders have distinct roles and access privileges within the platform.

Authentication mechanisms are robustly implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access their accounts and place orders. These mechanisms include secure user login and password protection.

## Conclusion

Farm to Market is a sophisticated web application that brings together the agricultural and commercial sectors. By leveraging modern technologies and following industry best practices, it provides a user-friendly and secure platform for farmers and traders to conduct business efficiently. The careful integration of user management, item and equipment listings, order processing, and database management ensures a seamless experience for all users. In summary, Farm to Market is poised to make a significant impact on the agricultural supply chain, promoting accessibility and efficiency in the marketplace.
